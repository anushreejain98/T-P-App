### Ideas:
- Timetable for companies arriving.
- Student Profiles(Avoid repetition for refilling details every time )
- company profiles
- Selection statistics
- Applicable to (departments & CPI requirements)

### To do:
- One table will be of company(name, category,cpi requirements)
- Another table for student detail(name,roll no,dept,cpi,file attachment(resume)) one time
i.e Just needs to be filled one time,Then details can be fetched from unique id(roll no.)
- Third table connecting these two having foreign keys companyname and roll no. Maybe. To link them
- Also one page for schedule./calendar of coming companies
